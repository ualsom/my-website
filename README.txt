NextGen Cybersecurity Services
Overview
This project is a responsive website built for NextGen Cybersecurity, a company offering advanced digital security solutions. The website includes several key sections, including information about the company's services, a sign-up page, and additional resources for customers. The goal of this project is to provide a professional, user-friendly experience that highlights the company’s offerings.

Project Structure
The project includes the following main files:

index.html: The homepage, which introduces the company and provides access to core services.
signup.html: A dedicated page where users can create accounts to access NextGen’s services.
moreservices.html: A page that provides detailed information about additional services offered by NextGen.


Design Choices
1. Typography and Color Scheme
I chose the Poppins font for its modern and clean appearance, making the website look professional while ensuring readability. For the color scheme, I used a mix of blue (#0073e6) and white, which are commonly associated with trust, professionalism, and security.

2. Card-Based Layout
The service pages, especially moreservices.html, use a card-based layout to present services like Secure Code Review and Threat Intelligence. This layout helps users quickly scan through the available services while keeping the page visually structured.

3. Responsiveness
To ensure the site works well on different devices, I used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. This approach allows the layout to automatically adjust depending on the screen size, providing a consistent experience on both desktops and mobile devices.

Challenges Faced
1. Optimizing the Layout for Different Screens
Ensuring that the design scales properly across devices was one of the more significant challenges. I had to adjust the layout, especially in the services and additional services sections, to ensure readability and usability on both small and large screens.

2. Maintaining Consistent Design Across Pages
Ensuring consistency across multiple pages, such as left-sidebar.html for Threat Intelligence and signup.html, required careful attention to detail. Each page needed to follow the same design guidelines, such as font usage, color schemes, and layout structure, while still accommodating unique content.

Bonus Features
1. Additional Services
The moreservices.html page was extended to include two additional services: Vulnerability Assessment and Security Awareness Training. These new services further demonstrate the comprehensive cybersecurity offerings of NextGen.

2. Interactive Forms
The signup.html page includes a fully functional sign-up form where users can enter their details to create an account. The form includes validations for fields such as email, password, and confirm password, improving user interaction and security.

3. Smooth Navigation
I implemented smooth scrolling between sections of the homepage, allowing users to navigate seamlessly from the hero section to other areas like services and contact.

Future Improvements
